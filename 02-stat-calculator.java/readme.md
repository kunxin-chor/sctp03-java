# Stats Calculator

1. Ask the users for numbers
2. Keep asking the user for numbers until they type in 'Q' or 'q' to quit
3. When the user stop entering numbers, calculate the following:
   1. the mean: average (find the total / 3)
   2. the mode: occurs the most
   3. the median: right in the middle


## Three Things to Consder
1. The model aka - how to use variables to represent the problem and the answer
   - ArrayList instead of Array (array in Java only stored fixed number)
2. Input - how do get the numbers in our ArrayList: while the user never type in q or Q, keep asking for numbers and store in the ArrayList
3. Processing:
   - mean: sum of the array / number of elements in array
   - mode: count the number with the highest occurence (most tedious)
   - median: find the number in the middle of the array
4. Output:
   - how to display the results
